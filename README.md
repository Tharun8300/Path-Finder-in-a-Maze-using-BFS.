This project implements a maze solver using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. It reads a maze from a file, finds the shortest path from the Start ('S') to the End ('E'), and marks the path using '*' characters.

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- Graph traversal on a 2D grid
- Queue implemented with a list (no libraries)
